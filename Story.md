"Injecting Soul into Host Body... 30%... 60%..."  
**(SOUND: A violent, dissonant buzz. Like a game freezing.)**

**III. THE AWAKENING (The Mechanics Explained)**

**NARRATIVE:**  
You are sitting at a desk in a void. On the screen, you see a readout of a body—**The Vessel**.  
Because your soul wasn't put *inside* the body, you don't feel its pain directly. You interpret it as **Data**. You are safe behind the screen, but the Vessel is paralyzed without your commands.  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> SENSORY DATA RECEIVED.  
\> EXTERNAL TEMPERATURE: 4°C.  
\> SMELL: COPPER, ROT.  
\> VESSEL HEART RATE: 0 BPM (STASIS).  
\> WARNING: VESSEL WILL EXPIRE WITHOUT PILOT INPUT.  
\> ACTION REQUIRED: JUMPSTART HEART.  
**(PLAYER INPUT: EXECUTE JUMPSTART)**  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> SENDING VOLTAGE...  
\> VESSEL HEART RATE: 120 BPM.  
\> STATUS: AWAKE.  
**NARRATIVE:**  
On the screen, the text feed spikes. The Vessel gasps, shaking off the stasis. You didn't feel the shock, but you saw the power usage spike on your monitor.  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> VISUAL FEED: ONLINE.  
\> SCANNING SURROUNDINGS...  
\> YOU ARE IN: THE CORPSE PIT.  
\> DESCRIPTION: A DISCARDED MASS GRAVE BENEATH THE CITY.  
\> ENTITIES DETECTED: 1 HOSTILE.

**IV. THE TACTICAL ADVANTAGE (The "External" Benefit)**

**NARRATIVE:**  
The Vessel sees a Goblin Scavenger and is terrified (STATUS: PANIC). It wants to freeze.  
But **you** are not in the pit. You are watching the code. You see something the Vessel's eyes missed.  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> ALERT: ENEMY DETECTED.  
\> TARGET: GOBLIN SCAVENGER.  
\> DISTANCE: 3 METERS.  
\> SYSTEM ANALYSIS (PILOT VIEW):  
\> TARGET IS OFF-BALANCE.  
\> PROBABILITY OF COUNTER-ATTACK: 0%.  
\> TACTICAL OPTION AVAILABLE:  
\> \[ENGAGE\] \- STRIKE WHILE VULNERABLE.  
**NARRATIVE:**  
This is your power. The Vessel sees a monster; You see a math problem with an easy solution.  
**(PLAYER INPUT: ENGAGE)**  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> COMMAND RECEIVED.  
\> MOVING VESSEL...  
**(SOUND: Wet crunch.)**  
**TERMINAL:**  
\> THREAT ELIMINATED.  
\> THE EXTERNAL LINK IS STABLE.  
\> WELCOME TO ELDORIA, OPERATOR.  
**(FADE TO BLACK)**
